# It's bleak and it's snowing again : (
#I long to see the sunshine and really miss the summer months, at least i have the comfort of winter foods,
the stews, soups and even porridges during these cold, dreary months gives me something to look forward to everyday.
I might even put on some weight, need to start going to the gym again, i think i may have put on some weight already ; )
